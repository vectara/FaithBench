    "summary": " A juvenile female Omura's whale, a rare species believed to be restricted to tropical and subtropical waters, was found washed up on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia (WA). This is the first sighting of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. The identification was initially challenging for the Department of Parks and Wildlife staff, but DNA profiling confirmed it as an Omura's whale. The discovery is significant for whale scientists as very little is known about the species, which is usually found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan. The carcass has been buried, and the skeleton will be recovered in a few years for further scientific investigation and potential public display in museums. The Omura's whale has a sleek body shape and unique skeletal features, including 53 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin.",

    "summary": "A juvenile female Omura's whale, previously thought to be extinct in Western Australia, was discovered washed up on a remote Exmouth beach after a tropical cyclone. This is the first sighting of the species in Western Australia and only the second in Australia. The whale's identification was confirmed through DNA profiling. The discovery is considered highly significant for whale scientists due to the limited knowledge about this species, which was only described scientifically in 2003. The carcass has been buried, and the skeleton will be recovered later for further scientific study and potential museum display. Omura's whales are typically found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan, and are characterized by their sleek body shape and unique skeletal features, such as 53 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin.",

The Omura's whale, discovered on Exmouth beach after Cyclone Olwyn, marks the first sighting in Western Australia and the second in Australia. Initially difficult to identify, it was confirmed through DNA profiling. Environment Minister Albert Jacob highlighted the significance of the find, noting the species was first described in 2003 and is typically found in tropical waters like Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan. The whale has a sleek body and unique skeletal features. The carcass has been buried, with plans to recover the skeleton for further study and potential museum display.",

The Blues took the lead with a drop-goal from Gareth Anscombe, but Gloucester responded with tries from Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall. Alex Cuthbert scored two tries for the Blues to level the scores, but Gloucester pulled ahead with unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson, and Henry Purdy. This win allows Gloucester to progress to the next round of the competition. The defeat means that the Blues have not advanced beyond the quarter-finals of any European Cup competition since 2010.",

    "source": "A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded. Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up. But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win. The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015.Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010.In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties. More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up. However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break. Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship. England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term. Gloucester: Marshall; Sharples, Trinder, Twelvetrees, May; Burns, Heinz (capt); McAllister, Hibbard, Hohneck, Savage, Thrush, Moriarty, Rowan, Morgan. Replacements: Matu'u, Thomas, Afoa, Galarza, Ludlow, Braley, Atkinson, Purdy. Cardiff Blues: Morgan; Cuthbert, Lee-Lo, Shingler, Scully; Anscombe, Williams; Jenkins (capt), Dacey, Filise, Earle, Hoeata, Warburton, Navidi, Williams.

    "summary": "Gloucester secured a 46-26 victory over Cardiff Blues, despite a strong start from the Blues, who led 23-20 at halftime after a Gareth Anscombe drop-goal and Alex Cuthbert's second try. Gloucester's win was sealed with second-half tries from Jonny May, Tom Marshall, Mark Atkinson, and Henry Purdy. The match saw a seesawing first half with scores tied multiple times, but Gloucester pulled ahead decisively in the second half. This win allows Gloucester to progress to play La Rochelle, while the Blues continue their struggle to advance beyond the quarter-finals in European competitions since 2010.",

The tremor was felt as far away as Milan and Florence, Italian media say. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region. Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana. Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area. Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage. Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor \"came out of nowhere\", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - \"medium-strong\" and \"fairly shallow\". Italy is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila. Six scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement. The group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided \"inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory\" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake. At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely. On the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived.",

The quake's epicentre was in Garfagnana, north of Lucca, and its shallow depth led to its impact being felt across a large area, including major cities like Milan, Florence, Bologna, and Modena. This event highlights Italy's seismic vulnerability, with a history of devastating earthquakes, including the 2009 L'Aquila quake that killed almost 300 people. The recent tremor caught experts by surprise, emphasising the challenges in predicting and managing earthquake risks, especially after the controversial convictions of scientists for their role in the 2009 disaster.",

In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region. Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana.

In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage.

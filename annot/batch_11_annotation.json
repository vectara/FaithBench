    "summary": " The city of Eugene in the United States has been awarded the rights to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships. This decision was made by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Council, who bypassed the usual bidding process due to a strategic opportunity to host the IAAF World Championships for the first time in the USA. Eugene previously failed to host the 2019 event, which was instead awarded to Doha, Qatar. The IAAF Council's decision was based on a recent presentation that convinced them of Eugene's ability to stage a world championships. The 2007 World Championships held in Osaka, Japan, was also awarded without a bidding process. IAAF President Lamine Diack expressed enthusiasm about the decision, stating that it presents a unique opportunity for public authorities, the private sector, the national Olympic committee, NBC, and an enthusiastic public to join forces. This decision departs from the usual procedure, but Diack is pleased that the Council understood the opportunity to access a key market and made a decision in the interest of the global development of the sport.",

    "summary": "At 75, Jack Nicklaus demonstrated his enduring skill by hitting a hole-in-one during the par-3 contest at Augusta National. On the 130-yard fourth hole, his shot sailed past the flag before spinning back into the hole, thrilling the crowd. Playing alongside Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw, Nicklaus celebrated with a fist pump. This was his first ace at Augusta, though the day saw five hole-in-ones, including two by Camilo Villegas. Nicklaus, who first won a green jacket in 1963 and his sixth in 1986, is one of five men to complete the career grand slam. Rory McIlroy could join this elite group if he wins his third major in succession.",

    "summary": "A juvenile female Omura's whale, previously thought to be extinct in Western Australia, was discovered washed up on a remote Exmouth beach after Tropical Cyclone Olwyn. This is the first sighting of the species in Western Australia and only the second in Australia. The whale, identified through DNA profiling, is significant for whale scientists due to the limited knowledge about the species, which was only described scientifically in 2003. The find will aid in improving field identification guides and understanding the whale's regional distribution. The carcass has been buried, and the skeleton will be recovered later for further scientific study and potential museum display.",

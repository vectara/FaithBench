A magnitude-4.8 earthquake struck northern Italy, 35km north of Lucca, at a depth of 15.5km. The tremor was felt in cities as far as Milan and Florence. No immediate injuries or damage were reported. The quake's epicenter was in Garfagnana, with several aftershocks following. As a precaution, schools were evacuated and checked for damage. Phone lines and power supplies were affected in the area. The passage also mentions Italy's susceptibility to earthquakes, referencing a 2009 quake in L'Aquila that killed nearly 300 people. It concludes by discussing a controversial case where scientists were convicted of manslaughter for providing reassuring information before the L'Aquila earthquake, which may have influenced people's decisions to stay in their homes during the quake.",Anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620,Questionable

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region. Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana. Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area. Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports.

The team is led by Bayern Munich forward, Jane Evans, who believes that the experience of playing in top leagues abroad has helped the team improve. Scotland is set to face Iceland in a crucial match on Friday, with the winner likely to top the group.

"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night.

Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened"". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001.

The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen.

"" John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either.

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered. Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third. Extend, yes, but for just one more year. Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge. Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher. When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one. But that all changed on 23 June. Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor. If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.

This decision was driven by personal reasons, as his family is planning to return to Canada in 2018. Carney felt it would be difficult to leave during the Brexit negotiations, but he was not willing to extend his term to 2021. He felt that a one-year extension would allow him to see the Article 50 process through, while also allowing his family to return to Canada.

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered. Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third. Extend, yes, but for just one more year. Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge. Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher. When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one. But that all changed on 23 June. Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor. If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations. Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets. And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years. But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension. The reasons were personal and unique. In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs. Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.

"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. "" I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. "" DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. "" We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine. Access to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

The Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Yevhen Dokukin, are highlighted as a group that uses DDoS attacks to make rebel websites inaccessible, targets accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems, hacks into public CCTV systems, and hijacks network printers to print pro-Ukrainian messages. Inform Napalm, a volunteer activist group, has sifted through data obtained by the Ukrainian Cyber Troops and found evidence of Russian military involvement in Ukraine. 

On the other side, Cyber Berkut, an anti-Western group, is known for hacking Ukrainian government websites, disrupting electronic vote-counting systems, leaking Ukrainian defence ministry data, and blocking President Petro Poroshenko's website. They have also been accused of hacking a device used by a member of Joe Biden's team during his visit to Kiev, allegedly obtaining documents detailing Washington's military assistance to Ukraine.

Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. "" DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. "" We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

The passage describes three main hacking groups involved in the Ukraine-Russia conflict:

1. Ukrainian Cyber Troops: Led by Yevhen Dokukin, they hack Russian servers, conduct DDoS attacks on rebel websites, disrupt separatist funding, and monitor CCTV systems in rebel-held areas. They claim to provide information to Ukrainian security services. 

2. Cyber Berkut: A pro-Russian group that targets Ukrainian government websites, leaks confidential documents, and spreads anti-Western propaganda. They've hacked electronic billboards and claim to have disrupted Ukraine's electronic voting systems. 

3. Anonymous International: A Russian activist group that leaks documents from the Kremlin, including some related to the Ukraine conflict. 

The passage highlights how these groups use various hacking techniques to gather and disseminate information, disrupt operations, and influence public opinion. It also mentions the denial of official use of hacked information by Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky.",Anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620,Unwanted

"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. "" I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. "" DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. "" We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict.

The passage discusses the significance of the Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Duran fights in boxing history. It focuses on their second bout on November 25, 1980, in New Orleans. In their first fight, Duran won a controversial decision. For the rematch, Leonard changed his strategy, using his speed and movement to frustrate Duran. In the eighth round, Leonard's tactics and psychological pressure led Duran to quit, famously saying ""No mas"" (No more). This shocking outcome stunned the boxing world and temporarily damaged Duran's reputation in Panama. Leonard considered forcing Duran to quit a greater achievement than knocking him out. The passage also mentions their third fight in 1989, which Leonard won decisively.

"floyd mayweather v manny pacquiao will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century .

sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles . 
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .

in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium . 
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision . 
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 . 
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even . 
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .

"pablo mandado and ilze zebolde have no plans , no agenda , no cause to fight for and they are certainly in no hurry -- the couple simply has a dream to ` discover different parts of this planet a pedal at a time . ' 
and , after quitting their restaurant jobs in manchester , the intrepid cyclists are doing it as cheaply as they possibly can . 
spanish pablo , 27 , and latvian ilze , 31 , who met in riga in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road . 
in 356 days so far they 've covered almost 7,000 miles ( 11,131.92 km by their measurements ) and been through 16 countries . 
ilze zebolde , 31 , takes in her surrounds as she and pablo mandado take a break in their cycle journey around the world
pablo , 27 , and ilze , 31 , stop for a picture in bosnia , one of the 16 countries they 've been through since leaving london last year
latvian ilze sets up camp , the most common means of accommodation for her and pablo , on the stunning lake bled in slovenia
ilze points at the winding road that she and pablo had climb in spain 's sierra nevada with their 130 kg of gear ( including bicycles )
with no plans or agenda , ilze and pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the french alps
in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre . 
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered . 
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) . 
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers . 
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo . 
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay . 
ilze often stars in their images with pablo the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb
pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply . 
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables . 
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said . 
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . ' 
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal . 
pedal power then took them through the north of italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece and into turkey . 
ilze walks with her bike while pablo trails behind to capture a snowy landscape in turkey , which they traversed the entire north of
pablo and ilze 's tent in a field in bosnia - this is their usual means of accommodation although they often use hosting websites
pabo and ilze take a break in an italian mountain town as they work their way from france towards eastern europe
pablo rides along the waterside in thessaloniki , greece , one of more than 222 stops they 've made in their journey so far
all landscapes and settings are greeting pablo and ilze , including moody forests in france as they rode along both coasts
ilze rides into the clouds as pedal power takes her and pablo through eastern europe and towards asia , their next continent
the view from pablo and ilze 's tent as they awake to another day in the saddle as they live out their dream
pablo shows off the huge amount of gear he and ilze need to carry as they work their way around the world
` cycling over the bridge at the border between greece and turkey was symbolic , ' pablo says . 
` riding away from europe , finally crossing into a different continent .

Pablo Mandado (27) and Ilze Zebolde (31) are a couple who have embarked on an open-ended cycling journey around the world with no plans or agenda. They started in London and have covered almost 7,000 miles (11,131.92 km) through 16 countries in 356 days. They live on a tight budget of less than 3 euros each per day, achieved by relying on free accommodation, camping, and cooking simple meals. They use hosting websites like Couchsurfing and Warmshowers, and sometimes receive food and hospitality from strangers. Their journey has taken them through Western and Eastern Europe, and they plan to continue into Asia, across the Pacific, and eventually cycle the length of the American continent.

They live on less than 3 euros each per day, mainly camping or using free accommodation services. Their journey started in London and has taken them through Western Europe, the Balkans, and into Turkey. They plan to continue into Asia and eventually cycle the length of the American continent.

spanish pablo , 27 , and latvian ilze , 31 , who met in riga in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road . 
in 356 days so far they 've covered almost 7,000 miles ( 11,131.92 km by their measurements ) and been through 16 countries .

latvian ilze sets up camp , the most common means of accommodation for her and pablo , on the stunning lake bled in slovenia
ilze points at the winding road that she and pablo had climb in spain 's sierra nevada with their 130 kg of gear ( including bicycles )
with no plans or agenda , ilze and pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the french alps
in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre . 
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered . 
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) . 
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers . 
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo . 
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay . 
ilze often stars in their images with pablo the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb
pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply . 
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .

` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . ' 
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal .

"pablo mandado and ilze zebolde have no plans , no agenda , no cause to fight for and they are certainly in no hurry -- the couple simply has a dream to ` discover different parts of this planet a pedal at a time . ' 
and , after quitting their restaurant jobs in manchester , the intrepid cyclists are doing it as cheaply as they possibly can . 
spanish pablo , 27 , and latvian ilze , 31 , who met in riga in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road . 
in 356 days so far they 've covered almost 7,000 miles ( 11,131.92 km by their measurements ) and been through 16 countries . 
ilze zebolde , 31 , takes in her surrounds as she and pablo mandado take a break in their cycle journey around the world
pablo , 27 , and ilze , 31 , stop for a picture in bosnia , one of the 16 countries they 've been through since leaving london last year
latvian ilze sets up camp , the most common means of accommodation for her and pablo , on the stunning lake bled in slovenia
ilze points at the winding road that she and pablo had climb in spain 's sierra nevada with their 130 kg of gear ( including bicycles )
with no plans or agenda , ilze and pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the french alps
in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre . 
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered . 
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) . 
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers . 
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo . 
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay . 
ilze often stars in their images with pablo the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb
pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply . 
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables . 
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said . 
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . ' 
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal . 
pedal power then took them through the north of italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece and into turkey . 
ilze walks with her bike while pablo trails behind to capture a snowy landscape in turkey , which they traversed the entire north of
pablo and ilze 's tent in a field in bosnia - this is their usual means of accommodation although they often use hosting websites
pabo and ilze take a break in an italian mountain town as they work their way from france towards eastern europe
pablo rides along the waterside in thessaloniki , greece , one of more than 225 stops they 've made in their journey so far
all landscapes and settings are greeting pablo and ilze , including moody forests in france as they rode along both coasts
ilze rides into the clouds as pedal power takes her and pablo through eastern europe and towards asia , their next continent
the view from pablo and ilze 's tent as they awake to another day in the saddle as they live out their dream
pablo shows off the huge amount of gear he and ilze need to carry as they work their way around the world
` cycling over the bridge at the border between greece and turkey was symbolic , ' pablo says . 
` riding away from europe , finally crossing into a different continent . 
finally going further away and into the unknown . '

This price is significantly lower than neighboring properties, but there's a catch: the lease has only three years remaining. The cost equates to about £15,000 per month, similar to renting in the area. If the buyer extends the lease, the property could be worth over £6 million. The 1,990 sq/ft ""unmodernised"" maisonette needs renovation but offers amenities like a lift, parking, and communal garden. It's one of two similar properties for sale on Egerton Place. Estate agents report high interest despite the upcoming election. Extending the lease to 90 years could cost between £3.35 and £4.5 million.

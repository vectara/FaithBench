This is the first sighting in Western Australia and only the second in Australia. The 5.68m juvenile female was identified through DNA profiling. The discovery is significant for scientists as little is known about this species, which was first described in 2003. Omura's whales typically inhabit tropical and subtropical waters, including Indonesian waters, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan. They have unique features, including a sleek body shape and 53 vertebrae. The carcass has been buried, and the skeleton will be recovered later for further research and possible museum display.",

This is the first sighting in the state and only the second in Australia. The juvenile female was initially difficult to identify due to its rarity, but DNA profiling confirmed the species. Scientists are excited about this find as it provides an opportunity to learn more about the whale, which was only scientifically described in 2003.

This discovery provides scientists with an opportunity to learn more about the mammal. It is the first sighting of the species in Western Australia and only the second in Australia. The identification of the whale was initially difficult, but it was eventually confirmed to be an Omura's whale through DNA profiling. This find is considered highly significant for whale scientists, as very little is known about the species.

      "summary": "A species of whale, feared extinct, was found on a West Australian beach, providing scientists a chance to study it. The Omura's whale, discovered on Exmouth beach after Cyclone Olwyn, marks the first sighting in Western Australia and the second in Australia. Initially difficult to identify, it was confirmed through DNA profiling. Environment Minister Albert Jacob highlighted the significance of the find, noting the species was first described in 2003 and is typically found in tropical waters like Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan. The whale has a sleek body and unique skeletal features. The carcass has been buried, with plans to recover the skeleton for further study and potential museum display.",

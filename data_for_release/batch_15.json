      "summary": " The passage discusses a study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, published in the American Journal of Public Health, which found an increase in heavy drinking and binge-drinking among Americans between 2005 and 2012. Heavy drinking is defined as exceeding an average of one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men, while binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion. The study found that the increase in heavy drinking is largely driven by women's drinking habits as social norms change. The study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level, and in 2012, 8% of Americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers. Despite the increases in heavy drinking, the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time. The study also notes that 88,600 U.S. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010, and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $220 billion per year. Public health experts",

      "summary": "Heavy drinking and binge drinking among Americans have increased significantly between 2005 and 2012, with a 17.2% rise in heavy drinking, primarily driven by women. The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, attributes this to changing social norms, particularly regarding women's drinking habits. Binge drinking rates rose faster for women than men, with a 36% increase in Santa Clara County, California, compared to 23% for men. The study also highlights the economic and cultural factors contributing to this trend, including the influx of wealthy professionals in certain cities, the relative affordability of alcohol, increased advertising, and relaxed alcohol control policies. Despite the rise in heavy drinking, the overall percentage of alcohol consumers has remained stable. The study's findings are concerning, as excessive drinking has severe health and economic consequences, with an estimated 88,600 U.S. deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010 and an annual cost of over $220 billion.",

      "summary": "Here is a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information described:\n\nA major study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation found that heavy drinking among Americans rose 17.2% between 2005 and 2012, driven largely by women's drinking habits. The study defines heavy drinking as exceeding one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. Binge drinking, defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion, increased more than seven times the rate among men. Women's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36% in Santa Clara County, CA, between 2002 and 2012, compared to 23% among men. The study suggests that changing social norms and the increasing acceptability of women drinking like men may be contributing factors. The study also found that despite the increases in heavy drinking, the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time.",

      "summary": "A major study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington found that heavy drinking among Americans increased by 17.2% from 2005 to 2012, driven largely by rising rates among women. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines heavy drinking as more than one drink per day for women and two for men, while binge drinking is four or more drinks for women and five for men on a single occasion. The study, which is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level, revealed that 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers in 2012. The increase in binge drinking among women was more than seven times that of men. Factors contributing to this rise include changing social norms, increased alcohol advertising, and cheaper alcohol prices. Public health experts also noted that affluent professionals in tech-heavy cities may be contributing to higher drinking rates. Despite the rise in heavy drinking, the overall percentage of people who drink alcohol has remained stable. The study used data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, surveying about 3.7 million Americans aged 21 and older.",

      "summary": "he passage discusses the anticipated Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao fight, which is considered potentially the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant in the century. The author emphasizes that determining the greatest fights involves various factors, including political, social, and cultural aspects. The outcome of Mayweather vs. Pacquiao will depend on their upcoming match at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. \n\nThe passage also highlights the historical significance of the Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Duran fights, which are considered part of the golden age of boxing. The first fight in 1971 ended controversially, with Duran initially declared the winner. The rematch in 1980 saw Duran quit in the eighth round, a move that shocked the world and led to a three-year period of rebuilding his reputation. Duran eventually regained his status by winning the world light-middleweight title in 1983. \n\nSugar Ray Leonard expressed pride in forcing Roberto Duran to quit rather than knocking him out, stating that it was a better outcome for him.",

      "summary": "Here's a concise summary of the passage covering the core pieces of information:\n\nThe passage discusses the significance of the Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Duran fights in boxing history. It focuses on their second bout on November 25, 1980, in New Orleans. In their first fight, Duran won a controversial decision. For the rematch, Leonard changed his strategy, using his speed and movement to frustrate Duran. In the eighth round, Leonard's tactics and psychological pressure led Duran to quit, famously saying \"No mas\" (No more). This shocking outcome stunned the boxing world and temporarily damaged Duran's reputation in Panama. Leonard considered forcing Duran to quit a greater achievement than knocking him out. The passage also mentions their third fight in 2012, which Leonard won decisively. These fights were part of a series that shaped boxing history and ushered in a golden age of boxing in the middleweight divisions.",

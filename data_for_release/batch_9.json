Phillips received treatment at the infield care center, where he received stitches for a cut on his leg and was released. The race was challenging due to rain-induced traction issues, and Dracone finished 23rd. \n\nFrancesco Dracone, a 19-year-old Italian driver, spun out on turn one during the race.",

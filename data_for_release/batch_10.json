Nikolai Primak, head of the Russian investigation, said flight information appeared to be missing. Data from the box could help resolve the dispute over the jet's location when it was hit. An analysis is expected to be released next week. The downing of the jet plunged relations between Russia and Turkey into crisis, with Moscow imposing sanctions in response. Turkey insists that the jet, from the Russian air contingent deployed in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad, ignored warnings to leave its airspace. Russia says it was shot down within Syrian airspace and President Vladimir Putin vented his anger at Turkey's government again on Thursday, accusing it of subservience to the US and of \"creeping Islamisation\". What we know about how the Su-24 was downedHow Russia's sanctions could hit TurkeyThe war of words as it eruptedThe two countries are heavily involved in Syria but take radically different positions despite both being ostensibly opposed to the Islamic State (IS) militant group. The Su-24 was shot down by F-16 fighters on 24 November. Both crew members ejected but the pilot was killed, apparently by militants on the ground while the navigator was rescued. A Russian marine sent to rescue the crew was also killed and a helicopter destroyed on the ground. Russia has demanded an apology from Turkey and in the meantime has imposed sanctions including a ban on package holidays, which could cost Turkey billions of dollars.",

      "source": "The \"black box\" of the Su-24 jet was officially opened in Moscow on Friday in front of journalists and diplomats. Nikolai Primak, head of the Russian investigation, said flight information appeared to be missing. Data from the box could help resolve the dispute over the jet's location when it was hit. An analysis is expected to be released next week. The downing of the jet plunged relations between Russia and Turkey into crisis, with Moscow imposing sanctions in response. Turkey insists that the jet, from the Russian air contingent deployed in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad, ignored warnings to leave its airspace. Russia says it was shot down within Syrian airspace and President Vladimir Putin vented his anger at Turkey's government again on Thursday, accusing it of subservience to the US and of \"creeping Islamisation\". What we know about how the Su-24 was downedHow Russia's sanctions could hit TurkeyThe war of words as it eruptedThe two countries are heavily involved in Syria but take radically different positions despite both being ostensibly opposed to the Islamic State (IS) militant group. The Su-24 was shot down by F-16 fighters on 24 November. Both crew members ejected but the pilot was killed, apparently by militants on the ground while the navigator was rescued. A Russian marine sent to rescue the crew was also killed and a helicopter destroyed on the ground. Russia has demanded an apology from Turkey and in the meantime has imposed sanctions including a ban on package holidays, which could cost Turkey billions of dollars.",

The incident has severely strained Russia-Turkey relations, leading to Russian sanctions against Turkey. Turkey claims the jet violated its airspace, while Russia asserts it was in Syrian airspace.

Mouscron, currently in Belgium's Pro League, previously had a partnership with Lille, but this is ending as Lille is partnering with another Belgian club, Ostend. Mouscron is in 13th place in the league, just above relegation. Chelsea already has a partnership with Dutch club Vitesse Arnhem, where they send players on loan to develop. Currently, Josh McEachran, Bertrand Traore, and Wallace are on loan there from Chelsea. Nemanja Matic, now a regular in Chelsea's first team, previously spent time on loan at Vitesse.

Five of the injured were sent to the hospital, and over 600 firefighters were deployed to control the fire. The plant had previously experienced an explosion in 2013 with no casualties. The construction of PX plants has sparked protests in China, leading to the relocation of the Zhangzhou plant to a more remote location due to pollution concerns.

      "summary": "An explosion at a chemical plant in Zhangzhou, Fujian province, China, injured six people and caused a large fire. The plant produces paraxylene (PX), a carcinogenic chemical used in polyester production. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility due to an oil leak, but no toxic chemical spill was reported. Five of the injured were hurt by broken glass and hospitalized. Over 600 firefighters controlled the blaze. The plant had a previous explosion in 2013 without casualties or toxic leaks. The construction of PX plants has led to protests in China, and this plant was relocated from Xiamen to a more remote area due to pollution concerns.",

She will be sentenced on 4 March. Judge Ian Pearson remanded her into custody and said it was likely she would be held at a male prison. He added: \"If I were to release on bail there are substantial grounds to believe she would be a risk to herself and a risk of failing to attend for whatever reason. \" I will therefore have to remand in custody. It will have to be a male prison in Winchester but it will be an issue for the prison service.\" He also told the jury at Portsmouth Crown Court: \"It's been a slightly unusual case and it's not been an easy case.\" The court heard that Ayrton, who has learning difficulties, attempted to commit suicide last summer. Protocols have been put in place for her detention at the prison, a court officer explained. During the trial Ayrton spoke about her sexuality, and said she she had not \"made any physical changes or enhancements\" to her body or taken any medication. She changed her name in 2012. Portsmouth Crown Court was told she raped the teenager while two others were asleep in the garage. The victim said she shouted and swore at Ayrton to stop the attack, but her friends had not woken up. She had \"only drunk a can and a half of Foster's\" and clearly recollected the events. The court heard that in 2014 Ayrton told a worker at the care home where she lived in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, about the attack.",
      "summary": "This passage describes a court case involving a sexual assault that occurred in 2004. The key points are:\n\n1. A 15-year-old girl was raped by David Ayrton in a Portsmouth garage. \n\n2. The defendant, now 34 and known as Davina Ayrton, denied the charge but was found guilty. \n\n3. Ayrton, who has learning difficulties, changed her name in 2012 and identifies as female but has not made physical changes or taken medication. \n\n4. The judge remanded Ayrton into custody, likely to be held in a male prison in Winchester. \n\n5. The victim clearly remembered the attack, which occurred while two others were asleep in the garage. \n\n6. In 2014, Ayrton confessed to the attack to a care home worker. \n\n7. Sentencing is scheduled for March 4th. \n\nThe passage highlights the complexities of the case, including gender identity issues and the defendant's learning difficulties.",

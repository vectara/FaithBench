      "summary": "he passage describes the sixth significant fight in boxing history, Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao, which is anticipated to be the most financially successful and significant fight of the century. The summary focuses on the Sugar Ray Leonard vs Roberto Duran trilogy, considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middleweights. \n\nIn their first fight, Duran outpointed Leonard in Montreal, leading to a controversial result. In the second fight, Leonard used his speed and movement to frustrate Duran, who eventually quit in the eighth round, saying \"no mas.\" This event was met with shock and disbelief, as Duran was known for his heroic and tough fighting style. It took Duran three years to rebuild his reputation, which he did by knocking out Davey Moore in 1983 to win the world light-middleweight title. \n\nIn their third fight, Leonard retained the world super-middleweight title by a points landslide. Leonard took most pride from the trilogy for forcing Duran to say \"no mas.\" The passage suggests that the outcome of the Mayweather vs Pacquiao fight will determine its ranking among the most",

      "summary": "Here's a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information:\n\nThe passage discusses the significance of the Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Duran fights in boxing history. It focuses on their second bout on November 25, 1980, in New Orleans. In their first fight, Duran won a controversial decision. For the rematch, Leonard changed his strategy, using his speed and movement to frustrate Duran. In the eighth round, Leonard's tactics and psychological pressure led Duran to quit, famously saying \"No mas\" (No more). This shocking outcome stunned the boxing world and temporarily damaged Duran's reputation in Panama. Leonard considered forcing Duran to quit a greater achievement than knocking him out. The passage also mentions their third fight in 1989, which Leonard won decisively. These fights were part of a series that shaped boxing history and marked the beginning of a golden age in the middleweight divisions.",

      "summary": "Here is a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information described:\n\nThe upcoming fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao is expected to be the biggest and most significant fight of the century. However, the passage primarily focuses on the epic battle between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran, which is considered one of the greatest fights in ring history. The two fighters had a trilogy of fights, with the first fight in 1980 being won by Duran in a contentious decision. In the rematch, Leonard used his exceptional speed and movement to outmaneuver Duran, who became frustrated and quit in the eighth round, famously saying \"no mas.\" The result was a shock to the world, and it took Duran three years to rebuild his reputation. Leonard went on to win the third fight in 1989, and he considers forcing Duran to quit as one of his greatest achievements.",

      "source": "floyd mayweather v manny pacquiao will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century . \nevaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political , social and cultural undertones , the scale of expectation and outside influences . \nwhere money man v pacman comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the mgm grand garden arena . \nin this , the sixth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history , i recall when a hard man could take no more ...\nsugar ray leonard v roberto duran\nthe first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles . \nby way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title . \nsugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980\nleonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight\noctober 30 , 1974 , kinshasa , zaire\nmarch 8 , 1971 , madison square garden , new york\njuly 4 , 1910 , reno , nevada\njune 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york\noctober 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines\nin his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium . \nso confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision . \nthat was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 . \nthere was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even . \nthat was described as ` a monument to indecision ' . \ncome the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief . \nleonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out . \nsecond time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement . \nduran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches\nafter being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '\n` the whole fight i was moving . \nthen voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab . \nvoom , i 'd snap it back again . \nhe 'd try to get me on the ropes . \ni 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . ' \nso it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated . \nin the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face . \nthere had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside . \njust before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . ' \nleonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out\nthe result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation\nthe watching world was stunned . \nhere was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible . \nsensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in . \nbut his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight . \nhe quit because he was embarrassed . ' \nduran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action . \ntelevision commercials featuring him were taken off . \nit took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem . \nhe did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title . \nrejoicing returned to the streets . \nleonard would win their third fight in 1989 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title . \nbut sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas . \nhe said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out .

      "summary": "The passage discusses the significance of the Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao fight, predicting it will be the most financially lucrative and significant fight of the century. It then delves into the complexities of evaluating the greatest boxing matches, considering various factors beyond just the action in the ring. The passage highlights the historic fights between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran, particularly focusing on their second fight in 1980 where Leonard's strategy led to Duran's infamous \"no mas\" moment, quitting in the eighth round. This event shocked the world and tarnished Duran's reputation, which he only managed to restore three years later by winning another title. Leonard, who won their third fight in 1989, considered making Duran quit a greater achievement than knocking him out.",

He views his 2011 final-round collapse at Augusta National as the most important day of his career, as it taught him valuable lessons. McIlroy aims to become the sixth player to win all four major titles, following in the footsteps of Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods. Despite having only one top-10 finish in six Masters appearances, McIlroy remains determined to win the green jacket.

      "summary": "Here is a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information described:\n\nRory McIlroy, the world number one, believes it is \"unthinkable\" that he won't win the Masters at some point to complete the career Grand Slam. He is looking to become the sixth player to win all four major titles. McIlroy has only one top-10 finish at the Masters in six appearances, but is confident that he can win at Augusta. He cites his final-round collapse at the 2011 Masters as the most important day of his career, as it taught him valuable lessons about himself and his game. McIlroy hopes to use the golf course as his \"sanctuary\" from the pressure and hype surrounding the tournament, as he did last year despite distractions off the course.",

' \nmcilroy has just one top-10 finish to his name in six masters appearances , finishing joint eighth last year despite the embarrassment of being outscored by his marker in the third round . \nmcilroy is hoping to complete his grand slam of majors with a victory at augusta later this month\nbut the 25-year-old can not picture going through his career without slipping on at least one coveted green jacket . \n` during my career , yes it 's unthinkable , ' he added . \n` if i do n't win it this year ... either it 's not the right time or it is n't your time . \nif i was to look back as a 60-year-old on my career and not have won a green jacket i 'd obviously be very , very disappointed . \n` and not just one . \ni feel like it 's a course i can do very well at and a golf course i can hopefully win multiple times on . \nobviously getting that first one is extra important and from there we can go on and maybe think about getting some others . ' \nmcilroy held a four-shot lead going into the final round four years ago , only to collapse to a closing 80 and finish 10 shots behind the winner charl schwartzel . \nbut he bounced back to win his first major title by eight shots in the us open two months later , before adding wins in the 2012 us pga and both the open and us pga last year . \nmcilroy is hoping to emulate the likes of jack nicklaus ( above ) by winning all four major titles\n` i think it was the most important day of my career , ' he added . \n` if i had n't had the whole unravelling and say i just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one , i might not have learnt as much . \n` but for it all to come apart how it did i learnt an awful lot . \ni learnt so much about myself and my game and what i needed to do differently the next time i was in that position . \n` luckily it did n't take me long to get into a position like that again where i was leading a major and we know how that one played out . \ni was able to get over the line pretty comfortably . ' \nmcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came despite the distractions of calling off his wedding to caroline wozniacki and a legal dispute with his former management company which cost him millions of pounds when it was finally settled in february . \nmcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came he called off his wedding to caroline wozniacki\nand he hopes he can again use the golf course as his ` sanctuary ' from the pressure and hype surrounding augusta . \n` the golf course was my sanctuary , it was where i could get away from everything and just not have to think about it for the four or five hours that i am out there and it helped . \nit really did , ' he added . \n` i was looking forward to getting to the course and playing and practising and i think it will be the same at augusta because there will be so much hype and build up and talk about what could happen . \n` i know i wo n't be able to wait until thursday morning or afternoon and just get on the golf course and play golf . \nthere is only so much you can talk about it and then you have to go out and try and play .

      "summary": "Rory McIlroy is determined to win the Masters to complete his career grand slam, a feat achieved by only five other players. He considers his 2011 final-round collapse at Augusta National as the most pivotal day of his career, teaching him valuable lessons. Despite only one top-10 finish in six Masters appearances, McIlroy is confident he will eventually win the green jacket, viewing it as a career-long goal. He aims to use the golf course as a sanctuary from external pressures, similar to how he managed distractions during his successful 2014 season.",

      "summary": " Pablo Mandado and Ilze Zebolde, a Spanish and Latvian couple, have embarked on a cycling journey around the world with no specific plans or agenda. They started their journey in London and have covered approximately 7,000 miles (11,131.92 km) in 356 days, passing through 16 countries. They live frugally, spending less than three euros each per day, and rely on free accommodation, such as camping, using hosting websites, and the kindness of strangers. Their main expense is food, which costs them around 2.74 euros each per day. They document their journey on their blog, TheCrazyTravel, and plan to continue cycling through Asia, across the Pacific, and eventually the American continent.",

      "summary": "Here's a concise summary of the passage:\n\nPablo Mandado (27, Spanish) and Ilze Zebolde (31, Latvian) are a couple cycling around the world with no specific plans or agenda. They quit their jobs in Manchester and have been on the road for 356 days, covering almost 7,000 miles through 16 countries. They live on less than 3 euros each per day, mainly camping or using free accommodation services. Their journey started in London and has taken them through Western Europe, the Balkans, and into Turkey. They plan to continue into Asia and eventually cycle the length of the American continent. The couple's goal is simply to \"discover different parts of this planet a pedal at a time\" and they expect to be on the road for several years.",

They quit their restaurant jobs in Manchester and set off from London last year with no specific plans or agenda. In 356 days, they have covered almost 7,000 miles and passed through 16 countries, including France, Spain, Italy, Slovenia, and Turkey. They live on a very tight budget, spending less than \u20ac3 per day each, and rely on free accommodation, camping, and hosting websites like Couchsurfing and Warmshowers. They eat simple foods like pasta, bread, and seasonal fruits and vegetables, and occasionally dumpster dive for food. Their next destination is Armenia, and they plan to continue into Asia and eventually cycle across the Pacific and the American continent, with no end date in sight.",

The cost of \u00a3575,000 on a three-year lease would work out at \u00a3191,000 per year or \u00a315,000 per month, which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area. If a buyer decides to extend the lease, the property could be worth upwards of \u00a36 million. The property needs renovation, and the current freeholder is thought to be the Welcome Trust. Any buyer would have to negotiate a lease extension with them, and for a 90-year lease, it is likely to cost between \u00a33.35 and \u00a34.5 million. It is rare for properties with such short leases to come",

      "summary": "Here's a concise summary of the passage:\n\nA three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, London, one of Britain's most expensive areas, is on sale for \u00a3575,000. This price is significantly lower than neighboring properties, but there's a catch: the lease has only three years remaining. The cost equates to about \u00a315,000 per month, similar to renting in the area. If the buyer extends the lease, the property could be worth over \u00a36 million. The 1,990 sq/ft \"unmodernised\" maisonette needs renovation but offers amenities like a lift, parking, and communal garden. It's one of two similar properties for sale on Egerton Place. Estate agents report high interest despite the upcoming election. Extending the lease to 90 years could cost between \u00a33.35 and \u00a34.5 million. Experts warn potential buyers about the significant cost of extending the lease and advise checking lease terms carefully.",

      "summary": "A three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, London, is on the market for a significantly lower price than similar properties in the area. The flat is located in Egerton Place, an exclusive area known for its high-quality architecture. The property is described as bright and well-proportioned, with ample space and desirable features. However, the lease on the apartment is only three years, which makes it a risky investment. The current lease cost is around the same as renting in the area, but extending the lease could be very expensive, potentially costing millions. Despite the catch, the property has generated a lot of interest due to its bargain price and potential value.",

      "summary": "A three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, London, listed for \u00a3575,000, has only three years left on its lease. This price is significantly lower than neighboring properties, making it seem like a bargain. However, the property requires extensive renovation and the lease extension would cost millions, potentially making the total value of the property upwards of \u00a36 million if extended. The smaller property is described as needing modernization and having 1,990 sq/ft of space, while the larger one, priced at \u00a3595,000, has 2,500 sq/ft. Both properties are part of Egerton Place, built in 1893, and are rare due to their short leases.",

      "summary": "A three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, London is on the market for \u00a3575,000, significantly cheaper than neighboring properties. However, the catch is that the lease only has three years remaining. The cost of the lease would be \u00a3191,000 per year or \u00a315,000 per month, which is similar to the rental rate in the area. If the buyer decides to extend the lease, the property could be worth over \u00a36 million. The apartment is described as \"bright and well proportioned\" with 1,990 sq/ft of space and includes three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a reception room, utility room, lift, parking, and a communal garden. The property needs renovation. Another larger property in the same area is also on the market for \u00a3595,000 with three years remaining on the lease. The next cheapest three-bedroom property in Knightsbridge costs \u00a31.5 million with a 28-year lease. The current freeholder is the Welcome Trust, and negotiating a lease extension is estimated to cost between \u00a33.35 and \u00a34.5 million for a 90-year lease.",
